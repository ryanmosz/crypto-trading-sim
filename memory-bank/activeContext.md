### Current Focus
Backend integration complete - ready to integrate auth into the game UI and start saving user data.

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Replace fake users (Alice/Bob/Quick Play) with real auth
2. Add login/signup UI screens
3. Save game results to past_runs table after each game
4. Build leaderboard view showing top scores
5. Show user's personal history and stats

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement "Now" mode with live prices from price_cache
2. Add social features (share results, challenge friends)
3. Create user profiles with achievements
4. Add more historical scenarios

### Technical Details
- Using Phaser 3.90.0
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL database
- MCP tools for programmatic Supabase management
