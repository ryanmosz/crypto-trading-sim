## Active Decisions

### Notification Design
- Using emoji icons (üèÜü•àü•âüéØ) for visual appeal
- Color coding: Green for win, yellow/orange for podium, orange for others
- 10-second auto-dismiss with manual close option
- Stack multiple notifications vertically

### Technical Considerations
- Using localStorage to track shown notifications
- Only querying games from last hour for performance
- Notifications integrated into DashboardScene
- Game completion redirects to dashboard automatically
- Cron job running every minute for real-time updates
