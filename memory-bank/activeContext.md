# Active Context - Current State

## Session Date: July 16, 2025

## What Was Just Completed

### Planning Phase Complete ✅
- Created comprehensive planning documentation (8 documents)
- Set up project infrastructure (Docker, Git, folders)
- Established modular architecture approach
- Defined 7-day sprint plan with daily milestones

### Project Structure Ready ✅
- Unity-compatible folder hierarchy created
- Docker environment configured for builds
- Git configuration files in place
- Build automation script ready

### Memory Bank Initialized ✅
- Created memory-bank folder structure
- Documented project requirements
- Captured technical decisions
- Ready for agent handoff

### Planning Folder Reorganized ✅
- Streamlined from 15 files to 11 files (including new bare minimum plan)
- Centered all documentation around PHASES.md
- Created phase-specific implementation guides
- Consolidated redundant content
- Removed files that said "what we could do" vs "what we will do"
- Added BARE-MINIMUM-PLAN.md for 2-hour quick ship option

### Test User Approach Added ✅
- Login screen with 2 pre-baked test users (Alice & Bob)
- Both start with $10M - showing how different choices lead to different outcomes
- Alice: $10M → $12M (+20% from smart BTC/ETH allocation)
- Bob: $10M → $8M (-20% from risky XRP-heavy strategy)
- No backend needed - perfect for MVP and demos
- Easy switching between users for testing different scenarios
- Updated bare minimum plan to include this approach

## Current Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Install Unity Editor** - In Unity Hub, install 2022.3 LTS with WebGL
2. **Create Unity Project** - 2D template in this directory
3. **Build Login & Main Scenes** - Using prepared scripts

### Today's Progress
- [x] Unity Hub installed ✅
- [x] Unity scripts prepared ✅
- [ ] Unity 2022.3 LTS with WebGL downloaded
- [ ] Unity project created
- [ ] Login scene built
- [ ] Main scene built
- [ ] WebGL build tested

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Technology**: Unity 2022.3 LTS with WebGL
2. **Architecture**: Modular, independent features
3. **Philosophy**: Ship playable build daily
4. **Visual Style**: Black background, cyan-to-pink gradients
5. **First Milestone**: Static welcome screen in 5 minutes

## Important Context for Next Agent

### Project Status
- Planning: ✅ Complete
- Infrastructure: ✅ Ready
- Unity Setup: ⏳ Pending
- First Screen: ⏳ Pending

### Critical Files to Review
1. `/planning/01-QUICK-START.md` - Start here
2. `/planning/03-INCREMENTAL-BUILD-PLAN.md` - Understand milestones
3. `/planning/05-DAILY-SPRINT-PLAN.md` - Daily execution

### Known Constraints
- Mac development environment
- Unity must have WebGL module
- Docker optional but recommended
- CoinGecko API has rate limits

## Next Agent Checklist

When continuing this project:
1. Read all memory-bank files first
2. Check planning/00-START-HERE.md
3. Follow quick start guide exactly
4. Commit after each milestone
5. Update this activeContext.md file
