  - Fixed countdown timer to use ends_at field
  - Created complete_expired_games() function
  - Past games now properly saved
  - Win/loss notifications now implemented

### Multiplayer Testing Phase
We've successfully implemented and tested all core multiplayer features:
- Game creation with unique codes
- Joining games
- Real-time leaderboards
- Individual portfolio tracking
- 6-minute quick games for testing

## Active Decisions

### Notification Design
- Using emoji icons (üèÜü•àü•âüéØ) for visual appeal
- Color coding: Green for win, yellow/orange for podium, orange for others
- 10-second auto-dismiss with manual close option
- Stack multiple notifications vertically

### Technical Considerations
- Using localStorage to track shown notifications
- Only querying games from last hour for performance
- Notifications integrated into DashboardScene
- Game completion redirects to dashboard automatically
