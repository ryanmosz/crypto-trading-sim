# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Testing & Deployment Phase** - Multiplayer implementation is complete and ready for comprehensive testing.

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Phase 4 (Scene Integration) - 100% COMPLETE
- ✅ All multiplayer features implemented and integrated
- ✅ Database cleaned and prepared for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive testing utilities created
- ✅ Second opinion document prepared for review

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing Phase (CURRENT)
The multiplayer system is ready for comprehensive testing:

1. **Two-Browser Testing**
   - Browser 1: Log in as adam@test.com
   - Browser 2: Log in as beth@test.com (private/incognito)
   - Use `test-multiplayer-comprehensive.html` for testing

2. **Test Scenarios**
   - Create game → Get code → Join game
   - Verify case sensitivity (Q92U ≠ q92u)
   - Test edge cases (join own game, duplicate joins)
   - Check leaderboard updates
   - Verify 60-second auto-refresh

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Multiple concurrent games
   - Rapid game creation
   - Price update triggers

### 2. Deployment Preparation
After successful testing:
- Deploy Edge Functions to production
- Update environment variables for production
- Set up automated price updates (cron job)
- Monitor initial usage

## Technical Status
- **Frontend**: All scenes updated with multiplayer features
- **Backend**: All Edge Functions deployed and tested
- **Database**: Schema supports all multiplayer features
- **Security**: RLS policies in place, service role keys secured

## Key Decisions Made
- 4-character case-sensitive game codes (62^4 possibilities)
- 60-second auto-refresh for leaderboards  
- Email display (usernames for future iteration)
- Manual price update triggers (cron job for future)
- Only 5 cryptocurrencies tracked (BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP)

## Active Questions
- Should we implement automated price updates now?
- Do we need a game browsing feature?
- Should we add push notifications for ranking changes?

## Implementation Complete ✅
The multiplayer feature is functionally complete and ready for testing!
