# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase 0 COMPLETE! ✅** - The scene extraction refactor has been successfully completed and tested.

### Achievements
Successfully extracted all 12 Phaser scenes from the monolithic 5,109-line `game.js` file into individual ES6 modules:
- 12 scene classes in `/scenes/` directory
- Shared components in `/shared/` directory (TutorialOverlay, TutorialManager, constants, utils)
- New `index.js` entry point managing all imports
- Updated `index.html` to use ES6 modules
- **All functionality tested and working correctly!**

### Testing Results (July 21, 2025)
User testing confirmed:
- ✅ Login flow works perfectly
- ✅ Single-player game flow functional (scenario → allocation → simulation → results)
- ✅ Dashboard with all tabs operational
- ✅ Now mode and multiplayer features intact
- ✅ Tutorial system working
- ✅ No console errors or module loading issues
- ✅ All Supabase operations functioning

## Recent Changes
- Completed Phase 0 scene extraction with surgical precision
- Modularized codebase while preserving 100% functionality
- Ran comprehensive testing - everything working as expected
- Created git restore point before refactoring (as mentioned by user)

## Key Decisions
- Original game.js preserved as backup
- Each scene is self-contained with proper ES6 imports
- Shared utilities centralized for easy maintenance
- Architecture now ready for Phase 1 multiplayer enhancements

## Active Issues
None! Phase 0 completed successfully with no outstanding issues.
