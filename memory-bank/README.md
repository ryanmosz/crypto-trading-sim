# ðŸ§  Memory Bank - Agent Knowledge Base

This folder contains the persistent memory for AI agents working on the Crypto Trading Simulator project. It ensures continuity between sessions and provides comprehensive project context.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank serves as the single source of truth for:
- Project requirements and goals
- Technical decisions and architecture
- Current progress and next steps
- System patterns and best practices

## File Structure & Reading Order

Read these files in order to understand the project:

1. **`projectbrief.md`** - Core requirements and project overview
2. **`productContext.md`** - Why this project exists and user goals
3. **`systemPatterns.md`** - Architecture and design patterns
4. **`techContext.md`** - Development environment and tools
5. **`activeContext.md`** - Current state and immediate next steps
6. **`progress.md`** - What's built and what remains

## Usage Guidelines

### For Agents
1. **Always read ALL files** when starting a new session
2. **Update `activeContext.md`** after significant changes
3. **Update `progress.md`** when completing milestones
4. **Add new patterns** to `systemPatterns.md` as discovered

### For Humans
- These files provide a complete picture of the project
- Check `activeContext.md` for the current state
- Review `progress.md` for completion status
- Refer to planning documents for detailed implementation

## Key Information

### Project Type
Unity WebGL cryptocurrency trading game

### Current Phase

## Relationship to Other Folders

- **`/planning/`** - Detailed implementation guides
- **`/research/`** - Original design documents
- **`/Assets/`** - Unity game files (to be created)
- **`/backend/`** - API server code (future)

## Maintenance

This memory bank should be updated:
- After each major milestone
- When technical decisions change
- Before handing off to another agent
- When discovering new patterns or solutions

Remember: This is the project's "brain" - keep it accurate and current!
