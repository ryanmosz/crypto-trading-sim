- Historical scenario gameplay (all 3 scenarios)
- Portfolio allocation system
- Real-time price simulation
- Results calculation and display
- Both test saves and real game saves work perfectly
- UI layout improvements prevent text overlap
- Now mode with real-time price tracking (100% functional)
- Active game saves and tracking
- Automated price updates with real CoinGecko data
- Multiplayer game creation and participation
- Tutorial system guiding new users through all features
- Session persistence (auto-login on page refresh)
