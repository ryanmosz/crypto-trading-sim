# Progress Tracker

## Overall Status
Phase 1 (Historical trading) is ~85% complete with core gameplay functional but save system needs fixes.

## What Works
- Complete authentication flow (login/signup)
- Dashboard displays past games correctly
- Past game details modal with two-page layout (main + details)
- Historical scenario gameplay (all 3 scenarios)
- Portfolio allocation system
- Real-time price simulation
- Results calculation and display
- Test game saves work (via Test Save button)
- UI layout improvements prevent text overlap

## Current Issues
1. Real game saves fail (not using Test Save button)
2. "Now" mode not implemented yet
3. Test Save button uses hardcoded profitable data even for crash scenarios (misleading)

### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones
