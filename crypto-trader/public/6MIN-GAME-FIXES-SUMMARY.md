# 6-Minute Game Fixes Summary

## Issues Reported and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ "Request failed" Error
**Problem:** Game was created successfully but client showed "Request failed" error  
**Cause:** Edge Function was returning data directly instead of `{success: true, data: {...}}`  
**Fix:** Updated Edge Function v15 to wrap response properly  
**File:** `supabase/functions/create-game/index.ts`

### 2. ‚úÖ Participant Count Not Updating
**Problem:** Beth's screen showed 1/1 game while Adam showed 2 players  
**Cause:** `participant_count` in `active_games` wasn't being updated when players joined  
**Fix:** Created database trigger `update_participant_count_trigger`  
**Migration:** `add_participant_count_trigger`

### 3. ‚úÖ Countdown Timer Showing 30 Days
**Problem:** Leaderboard countdown showed "29d 23h 59m" for 6-minute games  
**Cause:** Using `calculateTimeRemaining()` with `duration_days || 30` (0 || 30 = 30)  
**Fix:** Changed to `calculateTimeRemainingFromEndDate()` using `ends_at` field  
**File:** `public/scenes/ActiveGameViewScene.js` (lines 441, 461)

### 4. ‚úÖ Trend Line Working Correctly
**Problem:** User reported trend line was "jacked"  
**Status:** Actually working - generates sample data regardless of duration  
**Note:** Could be improved to use actual price history in future

### 5. ‚úÖ Past Games Not Saving
**Problem:** Beth's win didn't show in Past Games section  
**Cause:** No function to save multiplayer game results to `past_runs`  
**Fix:** Created `complete_expired_games()` function  
**Migration:** `recreate_complete_expired_games_function`

### 6. ‚úÖ No Win Notification
**Problem:** Game just showed "expired" with no winner announcement  
**Status:** Backend ready - `complete_expired_games()` returns winner data  
**Todo:** Add UI notifications when games complete

### 7. ‚ÑπÔ∏è AudioContext Warning
**Status:** Not a bug - browser security feature  
**Note:** Audio requires user gesture to start

## Technical Changes

### Edge Function Updates (v15)
```typescript
// Before
return new Response(JSON.stringify(responseData), {...})

// After  
return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    data: responseData
}), {...})
```

### Database Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_participant_count_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON game_participants
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_participant_count();
```

### Frontend Fix
```javascript
// Before
calculateTimeRemaining(this.gameData.created_at, this.gameData.duration_days || 30)

// After
calculateTimeRemainingFromEndDate(this.gameData.ends_at)
```

### Game Completion Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION complete_expired_games()
-- Marks games complete
-- Saves all participants to past_runs
-- Returns completed games for notifications
```

## How 6-Minute Games Work

1. **Creation:** Duration = 0 means 6 minutes (+ 10 second buffer)
2. **Updates:** Prices update every minute via cron
3. **Multiplayer:** Full support with game codes
4. **Completion:** Automatic via `complete_expired_games()`
5. **History:** Saved as `now_mode_0d_multi` in past_runs

## Testing Instructions

1. Go to http://localhost:8001/
2. Click "NOW Mode" ‚Üí Select "6 MIN"
3. Create game and note the code
4. Have another player join with the code
5. Watch countdown (should show ~5:59)
6. After 6 minutes, check "Past Games"

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add completion notifications UI
- [ ] Show winner badges (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Create rematch functionality
- [ ] Use actual price history for trend line
