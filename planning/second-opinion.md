## Conclusion

The multiplayer implementation is **functionally complete** for the core feature set. Users can:
1. Create multiplayer games with unique codes
2. Join games using case-sensitive codes
3. Compete with different strategies
4. Track real-time rankings on a leaderboard
5. See everyone's performance updated every minute
