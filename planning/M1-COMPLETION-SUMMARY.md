# ðŸŽ‰ M1 Complete: Auth Integration & Game Persistence

## Implementation Summary (July 19, 2025)

We successfully integrated Supabase authentication into the game and implemented automatic game result persistence!

### What We Built

1. **Authentication UI** âœ…
   - Replaced fake users (Alice/Bob/Quick Play) with real auth
   - Created email/password form with toggle between Sign In/Sign Up
   - Added session persistence (auto-login if already authenticated)
   - Implemented sign-out functionality

2. **Dashboard Scene** âœ…
   - New scene showing after successful login
   - Displays welcome message with user email
   - "PLAY NEW GAME" button to start playing
   - Shows last 10 games with results
   - Click on past games to replay that scenario

3. **Automatic Game Saving** âœ…
   - Results automatically save to `past_runs` table
   - Captures all game data:
     - scenario_key
     - allocations
     - final_value
     - profit_amount
     - profit_percent
   - No user action required - saves seamlessly

4. **Navigation Updates** âœ…
   - All scenes now pass user object properly
   - Back buttons return to dashboard when logged in
   - Consistent user experience throughout

### Technical Implementation

- **ES6 Modules**: Updated to use modern JavaScript imports
- **Async/Await**: Proper handling of all async operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for auth failures
- **HTML Form Overlay**: Clean integration with Phaser scenes
- **User State Management**: User object flows through all scenes

### Testing Instructions

1. **Start the game**:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-trader && python3 -m http.server 8001
   open http://localhost:8001/public/
   ```

2. **Create an account**:
   - Click "Don't have an account? Sign Up"
   - Enter email and password
   - Click SIGN UP

3. **Play a game**:
   - Click PLAY NEW GAME
   - Select a scenario
   - Allocate funds
   - Watch simulation
   - Results save automatically

4. **View history**:
   - Return to dashboard
   - See your past games listed
   - Click any game to replay that scenario

### Important Notes

- **Email Validation**: Disable email confirmations in Supabase dashboard
- **Test Emails**: Use real email formats (not example.com)
- **Session Persistence**: Stays logged in between page refreshes
- **Data Privacy**: Each user only sees their own games (RLS enabled)

### What's Next?

**M2: Now Mode** - Real-time multiplayer trading with live leaderboard
- Use current prices from price_cache
- Global leaderboard showing top traders
- Portfolio value updates every 5 minutes
- Competition mode!
