# Planning Folder Reorganization Summary

## What Changed

### Before (15 files)
- Multiple overlapping documents
- Redundant content across files
- No clear hierarchy
- Mixed "what we could do" with "what we will do"

### After (10 files)
- **Central document**: 07-MASTER-PHASES.md
- **Phase guides**: Specific implementation for each phase
- **Quick refs**: Setup and troubleshooting
- **Clear hierarchy**: All files referenced from master phases

## New Structure

```

## Key Improvements

1. **Clarity**: One central document (master phases) that references all others
2. **Action-focused**: Each phase guide tells you exactly what to build
3. **No redundancy**: Consolidated overlapping content
4. **Logical flow**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3, etc.

## Files Consolidated/Removed

- `00-START-HERE.md` → Content moved to master phases
- `02-DOCKER-SETUP.md` → Merged into setup-guide.md
- `03-INCREMENTAL-BUILD-PLAN.md` → Split into phase guides
- `04-TECHNICAL-SETUP.md` → Merged into setup-guide.md
- `05-DAILY-SPRINT-PLAN.md` → Split into phase guides
- `PROJECT-MANAGER-SUMMARY.md` → No longer needed

## Result

- **Reduced file count by 33%** (15 → 10 files)
- **Clear entry point** (master phases document)
- **No duplicate information**
- **Each file has specific purpose**
- **Actionable content only**

The planning folder is now efficient, focused, and ready for development!
