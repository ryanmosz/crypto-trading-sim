## 🏗️ Project Structure

Each phase builds on the previous one:
- **Phase 0**: Planning ✅ Complete
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (4 screens, navigation)
- **Phase 2**: Core Mechanics (allocation system)
- **Phase 3**: Live Data (dashboard, prices)
- **Phase 4**: Multiplayer (backend, leaderboard)
- **Phase 5**: Polish (effects, optimization)
- **Phase 6**: Launch

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **New to the project?** → Read [07-MASTER-PHASES.md](07-MASTER-PHASES.md)
2. **Want to start coding?** → Follow [quick-start.md](quick-start.md)
3. **Ready to build?** → Open [phase1-foundation.md](phase1-foundation.md)

## 💡 Key Principles

- **Ship Daily**: Each phase produces a working game
- **Modular Code**: Features are independent
- **Clear Goals**: Every phase has specific deliverables
- **Actionable**: Focus on what we WILL do, not what we COULD do

## 📊 Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Planning | 1 day | ✅ Complete |
| Foundation | 1 day | Ready to start |
| Mechanics | 1 day | Planned |
| Data | 1-2 days | Planned |
| Multiplayer | 2 days | Planned |
| Polish | 1 day | Planned |
| **Total** | **7-8 days** | **MVP** |
