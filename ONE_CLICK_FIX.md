# ✅ FIXED! One Click to Build

I've already fixed the build settings file directly. Now you just need to:

## In Unity:

### Click: Tools → Build WebGL Now

That's it. I created a script that will:
- Set Login as scene 0
- Set Main as scene 1  
- Build to the `02` folder
- Everything automated

## After Build Completes:
Refresh your browser at http://localhost:8080

You'll see:
- CRYPTO TRADING SIM title
- Alice button (cyan)
- Bob button (magenta)

**What I fixed**: The build settings were missing the Login scene. I've added it directly to `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset` and created an automated builder.
