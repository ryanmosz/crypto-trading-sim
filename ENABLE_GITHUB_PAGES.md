# ðŸš€ Enable GitHub Pages - Final Step!

Your deployment workflow is ready! Now you just need to enable GitHub Pages:

## Steps to Enable:

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**  
   https://github.com/ryanmosz/crypto-trading-sim

2. **Click on "Settings"** (top menu bar)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")

4. **Configure these settings:**
   - **Source**: GitHub Actions
   - That's it! (Don't select "Deploy from a branch")

5. **Save** if there's a save button

## What Happens Next:

1. The workflow will run automatically (check Actions tab)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for first deployment
3. Your game will be live at:  
   **https://ryanmosz.github.io/crypto-trading-sim/**

## Check Deployment Status:

- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo
- You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running or completed
- Green checkmark = Success!
- Click on the workflow run for details

## Troubleshooting:

If the page shows 404:
- Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source
- Check if the workflow completed successfully
- Wait a few more minutes (first deploy can be slow)
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

Once enabled, every push to main will automatically update your live game! ðŸŽ®
