# Initial Demo State

## Current Setup

Both test users start at **$10 million** - this represents the beginning of the 24-hour trading period before any investments have been made.

### Login Screen
- **Alice** button: Shows "$10M (Starting)" in cyan
- **Bob** button: Shows "$10M (Starting)" in magenta

### Main Screen (after login)
- Shows "Welcome, [User]!"
- Portfolio: $10.0M
- Performance: "$10M (Starting)"

### The Demo Concept

This is "Hour 0" of the trading competition:
1. Both users have just received their $10M virtual funds
2. They haven't made any trades yet
3. Alice is planning a conservative BTC/ETH strategy
4. Bob is planning a risky XRP-heavy approach

In the full game, after 24 hours:
- Alice might be at $12M (+20%) from smart allocation
- Bob might be at $8M (-20%) from risky bets
- But right now, they're tied at the starting line!

### Why This Matters

Starting both users at $10M clearly shows:
- Fair competition - everyone starts equal
- Your choices matter - different strategies lead to different outcomes
- Clean demo - no confusion about "how did they get to these values?"

### Next Steps

To show the "after 24 hours" state, you would need to:
1. Implement the allocation system (Phase 2)
2. Add live price data (Phase 3)
3. Calculate portfolio values based on crypto price changes

But for the bare minimum demo, showing the starting state is perfect!
