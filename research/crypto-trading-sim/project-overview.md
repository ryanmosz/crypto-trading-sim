# Crypto Trading Simulation Game

## Project Overview

A competitive cryptocurrency trading simulation game where players allocate investment portfolios across the top 5 cryptocurrencies and compete for the best returns over a predetermined time period.

## Core Concept

Players start with a fixed amount of virtual capital ($10 million) and must allocate percentages across 5 major cryptocurrencies. Once investments are locked in, the game tracks real-time price movements to determine winners based on portfolio performance.

## Featured Cryptocurrencies

1. **Bitcoin (BTC)** - The original cryptocurrency and market leader
2. **Ethereum (ETH)** - Leading smart contract platform
3. **BNB** - Binance Coin, major exchange token
4. **Solana (SOL)** - High-performance blockchain
5. **XRP** - Digital payment protocol

## Game Flow

1. **Registration**: Users create accounts to track scores and history
2. **Portfolio Setup**: Players use sliders to allocate percentages across 5 coins
3. **Lock-in Period**: Investments are finalized and cannot be changed
4. **Competition Period**: Real-time tracking of portfolio values
5. **Results**: Winners determined by final portfolio value

## Key Features (MVP)

- User authentication and account management
- Portfolio allocation interface with sliders
- Real-time price data integration
- Leaderboard and scoring system
- Historical performance tracking

## Technical Considerations

- **Modularity**: Built as an extensible system for future features
- **Data Source**: Need reliable cryptocurrency price API
- **Time Intervals**: Determine optimal competition duration (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **Scoring**: Simple percentage gain/loss calculation

## Future Expansions

- Multiple investment rounds
- Trading during competition
- More cryptocurrencies
- Different game modes
- Social features
- Educational content
