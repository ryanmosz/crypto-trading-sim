# Global Game Concept - Single Shared Competition

## How It Works

Instead of individual 24-hour games per player, **everyone competes in the same ongoing game**. This creates a more exciting, shared experience where all players are directly competing.

## Game Structure

### The Perpetual Game Model
```
Game Start                    24 Hours Later                48 Hours Later
    |                              |                              |
    |------------ Game 1 -----------|------------ Game 2 ---------|
    |                              |                              |
Player A joins ─────┐              │                              │
Player B joins ─────┤              │                              │
Player C joins ─────┤   All        │   Results      New          │
Player D joins ─────┤   compete    │   shown,       game         │
                    │   together   │   reset        starts       │
Player E joins ─────┘              │                              │
```

### Key Mechanics

1. **Fixed Game Windows**
   - Games run for exactly 24 hours
   - New game starts immediately after previous ends
   - Example: Daily games from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC

2. **Join Anytime**
   - Players can join the current game at any point
   - Late joiners compete from current prices (not start prices)
   - Shows "Time Remaining in Current Game"

3. **Shared Leaderboard**
   - All players see the same rankings
   - Real-time updates as fortunes change
   - Top 100 always visible

## Implementation Details

### Backend Structure
```javascript
// Global game state
const currentGame = {
    id: "game_2024_01_15",
    startTime: "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    endTime: "2024-01-16T00:00:00Z",
    startPrices: {
        BTC: 43567.23,
        ETH: 2234.56,
        BNB: 312.45,
        SOL: 98.76,
        XRP: 0.5432
    },
    players: [
        {
            username: "CryptoKing",
            joinTime: "2024-01-15T08:30:00Z",
            allocations: { BTC: 50, ETH: 30, BNB: 10, SOL: 5, XRP: 5 },
            initialValue: 10000000,
            currentValue: 10234567
        }
        // ... thousands more
    ]
};
```

### Unity Display
```csharp
public class GlobalGameDisplay : MonoBehaviour {
    public Text gameTimerText;
    public Text playerCountText;
    public Text yourRankText;
    
    void Update() {
        // Show time until game ends
        TimeSpan remaining = gameEndTime - DateTime.UtcNow;
        gameTimerText.text = $"Game Ends In: {remaining:hh\\:mm\\:ss}";
        
        // Show total players
        playerCountText.text = $"Players: {currentPlayerCount:N0}";
        
        // Show your position
        yourRankText.text = $"Your Rank: #{yourRank:N0} of {currentPlayerCount:N0}";
    }
}
```

## Advantages of Single Global Game

1. **Community Feel**
   - Everyone experiencing same market movements
   - Shared excitement during volatile periods
   - Water cooler moments ("Did you see SOL spike?")

2. **Simplified Backend**
   - One game state to manage
   - Easier leaderboard calculations
   - Clear winner each day

3. **Marketing Opportunities**
   - "Join 5,000 players in today's game!"
   - Daily winner announcements
   - Social media engagement

## Scaling Considerations

### When Popular (10,000+ players)
- Cache leaderboard aggressively
- Show top 100 + player's local area
- Use percentile buckets for ranking

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Efficient ranking query
WITH RankedPlayers AS (
    SELECT 
        username,
        current_value,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY current_value DESC) as rank
    FROM game_players
    WHERE game_id = 'current_game'
)
SELECT * FROM RankedPlayers 
WHERE rank <= 100 OR username = 'current_user';
```

## Social Features (Future)

1. **Global Chat** (moderated)
2. **Winner Interviews**
3. **Strategy Sharing**
4. **Team Competitions**

This single global game approach creates a shared, exciting experience that's perfect for building a community around your game!
