# 🔧 What I Fixed Automatically

## The Problem
- Unity WebGL build was starting at Main scene with no user ($0M)
- Login scene wasn't included in build settings

## What I Did

### 1. Fixed Build Settings Directly ✅
- Edited `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`
- Added Login scene (with correct GUID) as scene 0
- Main scene is now scene 1

### 2. Created Auto-Fix Scripts ✅
- **StartupBuilder.cs** - Runs automatically when Unity compiles, ensures scenes are correct
- **AutoBuilder.cs** - Adds "Tools → Build WebGL Now" menu option
- **QuickSceneFix.cs** - Adds "Tools → Fix Scene Build Order" option

### 3. Updated Code ✅
- MainScreenManager now redirects to Login if no user
- UserManager.Logout() has fallback to scene 0
- Cool visual effects already added to both scene builders

## What Happens Now

When Unity finishes compiling (you'll see in the progress bar):

1. **Automatic**: StartupBuilder will fix the scene order
2. **One Click**: Tools → Build WebGL Now
3. **Done**: Refresh browser after build

## Current Status
- ✅ Build settings fixed
- ✅ Multiple failsafes in place
- ✅ Cool effects included
- ⏳ Unity is compiling the new scripts
- ⏳ Ready to build when Unity is ready

**No more manual clicking through Build Settings!** Everything is automated.
